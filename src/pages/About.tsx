            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            
            <p>
              Founded in 2023, Netfie was born out of the frustration of having to use multiple platforms and install various software to accomplish simple digital tasks. We envisioned a world where all essential digital tools would be available in one place, accessible from any device with an internet connection.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              What started as a simple image converter has now grown into a comprehensive suite of tools spanning image editing, file conversion, text-to-speech, and much more. Our platform continues to evolve as we add new features and capabilities based on user feedback and technological advancements.
            </p>
